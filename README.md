# chess
Simple chess application, currently requires pygame and python to be installed. Will later look at possibility of having a pip install pygame function built in. Eventually if web hosted that step can be done server side and not effect users.

Would like to eventually allow it to have it's own engine, get hosted by django and use lichess API.

It's obviously a learning project.
